> 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM Stand-up [Morning]

This morning was spent getting smartly dressed with a suit, tie and blazer for the upcoming sales interview. In order
to put the preparation into practice I rehearsed the interview with a peer of mine. It went rather well and we were able to
give each other some feedback that we could take forward when looking on how to improve. 

> 9:30 AM - 9:40 AM Stand-up [Morning]

Today we had a very quick stand up as we are having interviews with Sales, I have been practicing the interviews.
Me and my peer gave our stand up and left to carry on revising.

> 11:40 AM Interview with Time McCharthy(Sales) [Late-Morning]

**Notes from interview**

I had an interview with Tim McCharthy from sales, at **11:40** AM on the **22/07/2020**.

* We had a discussion at the start about the interview process and just how the course was going, particularly
picking up on points that would tell Tim a little bit more about myself.

* Next I was asked to tell Tim a little more about myself, instead of going into a straight up Elevator pitch I made it a little more
personal by going through my elevator pitch points and highlighting achievements, goals and events that stand out to me
and also tried to get his feedback in places to make him more involved.
    * He was very impressed by the 1st Class I achieved at the end of my time in University.
    * I managed to include some essential parts such as the plan I have for myself in the next couple years, why I came to the
    training. How I feel at home in an intensive training environment as it gets to the point of technicalities much faster.
    * What I have learned so far in the academy and different competencies I have identified I have and those I am currently
    looking at to improve upon, with examples such as the 100% I achieved through being a more analytical person. Pseudo code
    I was able to plan my method of attack before going in, which lead to my success in the exam and shout out in the academy stand up.

**Tim** was very impressed by the way I delivered the pitch as I included him in it but also had all the relevant and important parts of
my journey in the academy so far and the skills and abilities I am bringing into the academy from University.

* Question: What is Agile
* I think I answered this well using the STAR methodology, including some SCRUM framework and then a conclusion that gave an
example of how we use this iterative approach everyday in the academy using Trello and the Kanban board, and briefly how each part works
and then a point about how it helps us in the progression and visualising our steps.

* Question: In which situation would you use the waterfall methodology, over agile?

I was asked this because I previously compared the agile to the waterfall, this was actually something I know very well as I have used it
before, I gave an answer that revolved around the idea that its used if the requirements of a project are known from the start, as a
pose to a project that doesn't know all the requirements, that may use the agile approach. 

I also use the example of a project
to create a washing machine; this is something that is not a innovation, it has been done before so it is known what
parts are needed to create the washing machine, however a complex web service that is implementing new functionality such as
scalability is always different for every project and is constantly changing on how it is to be implemented.

At the end Tim complemented me on the clear and consistent approach to which I answered the questions. He said I hit the nail
on the head in the way I answered each question. Out of 700 something people he has interviewed I am one of the clearest communicators he has come
across.
