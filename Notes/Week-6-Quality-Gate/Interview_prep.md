# Here I am going to go over the concepts that I need to revise for the Interview, including using **STAR**


* **SITUATION** - _Set the stage, context to situation or challenge faced._
    * **For example**, “In my last role as lead designer, my team was short-staffed and facing a 
    significant backlog of work. The account managers were setting unrealistic deadlines, 
    which was causing stress for my team and affecting morale.”
* **TASK** - _Describe your responsibility or role in the situation or challenge_
    * **For example**, “As a team leader, it was my role not only to ensure my team met 
    our deadlines but also to communicate bandwidth to other departments and keep my team motivated.”
* **ACTION** - _Explain how you handled the situation or overcame the challenge, if the action was carried out by
    a team, focus on your efforts._
    * **For example**, “I set up a formal creative request process including project timeline estimates 
    to set better expectations. I scheduled weekly meetings with account managers to discuss my 
    team’s bandwidth and share progress updates.”
* **RESULT**  - _What was the outcome you reached? quantify success or provide concrete examples of the effects of
    your efforts_
    * **For example**, “By providing more transparency into my team’s processes and setting better 
    expectations with the account managers, we were able to re-prioritize the design team’s to-do list
     and complete everything in our backlog. The following quarter, we shortened our average project 
     timeline by two days.”
     
* Q. What is Agile and SCRUM?
* A. Agile is a software development methodology based on an incremental, iterative approach. Agile
projects are open to change that may happen throughout the projects, and encourage constant feedback from end-users,
cross-functional teams working together to organise work into a backlog with priority. Where as SCRUM is a framework that
defines a specific set of rules to follow when practicing Agile software development. SCRUM is one way to implement
agile, with certain aspects such as the product backlog, sprint backlog, daily stand-ups or meetings, sprints and their 
respected review and later retrospective review as well as the ability to increment the projects progress.

> During my training at Sparta Global we were set the task of creating a program in python that would be capable of
>carrying out specific functionality required by an airport, this included the completion of what are known as user-stories in
>order to satisfy the requirements. I worked in a team of three and we set up a Kanban board in order to create an agile environment,
>this allows us to use the SCRUM artefact's such as the product backlog, sprints and DOD to incrementally move through the project
>making sure each user story was satisfied by breaking it down and adding it into our product backlog. Each day we would choose which items to
>add to the daily sprint, these were to be completed in that day. By using a Agile methodology and SCRUM artefact's and events the project ran incredibly smooth and allowed
>us to successfully complete all the user-stories 2 days before the deadline, this allowed the time to integrate the project into
>a single and more functional entity.
