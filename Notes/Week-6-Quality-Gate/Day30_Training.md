> 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM Stand-up [Morning]

Today we had a very short stand up, we talked about blockers and everything that is going well. For myself I have enjoyed this week a lot
including getting involved with web development again. I love how it goes hand in hand so well with Python and you don't need
to complete deviate to learning a whole new mini-language to use it. We learnt a lot more about Flask including the way it
interacts with the web using the MVC pattern. It is quite impressive too the capabilities that come from the Flask module as well.
It incorporates all types of features, including the use of sessions, secret-keys, cookies, URL, redirects and a lot more that I have yet to
find out about.


- **We will time-box our meeting for 10 minutes**
- **Please take notes, as you will be expect to email us the summary of our conversations...**
- **How did you think this week went?**
>**"** This week was actually really great, I learnt a lot of stuff that I didn't previously know about including flask and HTML inheritance,
>using the boilerplate framework (which is a framework that focuses on reusing text in multiple environments). I also got fully involved
>with the Flask framework for the first time. It is a great module that offers tons of functionality for working with web applications from
>within the python environment. 
>
>The way my interview went this week was really great, I was a little nervous beforehand but I practiced my
>elevator pitch about 100 times the night before and practiced the questions in the morning before. This allowed me to have it as a second nature
>when it came to the interview, I was able to clearly communicate every question that Tim asked, including a sneaky question that involved the waterfall
>methodology. He also gave me the compliment that I am a very clear communicator and probably one of the clearest that he has seen in the past 700 interviews.
>**"**
- From the behavioural competencies one competencies do you think you are excelling and which competencies you need to work one?
>**"**   Following on from the past two weeks of one-to-ones I feel like I have mastered the determination and am fully
>committed to this training, I am to go all the way as I feel very confident at the moment in my own ability and don't feel like
>I am behind or going to fall behind. This week however I have probably impressed myself mostly because I have been able to fully utilise my
>recently enhanced analytical skills in the work that I have done, both technical in the website development and non-technical by 
>planning and practicing strategically before the interview making sure I have something to say.
>
>I made sure to show up and show off as well, making sure that I told Tim everything that I am proud of, otherwise how will he know what
>I have achieved and what my strengths and weaknesses are.
>**"**
- One thing to start doing? 
>**"**  I think this week I have realised that it is not only good for others but myself as a person to look and act professional,
>although I have done it before I think this week with the proper interview practice it made me feel good to look smart.
>**"**
- One thing to stop doing? 
>**"**  Stop getting distracted during the lesson and perhaps try pay more attention on the person talking, as I am easily distracted.
>I am very studious about my learning so I love the fact that I can learn, so I try to make the most of my time but sometimes it may come across as rude.
>**"**
- One thing to continue?
> **"** As I have mentioned in multiple weeks before this I am actually finding myself during this course and becoming the determined and motivated
>individual that I know I can be. Therefore I am trying to keep enthusiastic and keep at the work as I do genuinely enjoy it, and it isn't
>a chore for me to build a website or code a program.
> **"**

* **Positive feedback** <br>
>**"** 
Shahrukh said he has no concerns with my progress so far, he said that I am on good track. The terms of the table, I have a strong technical leg, soft-skill leg and
non-functional skill leg of the table. He was impressed with my progress in the presentation and feedback as compared to the interview we initially had.
>**"**

* **Constructive feedback** <br>
>**"** 
Not much constructive, just to keep it up and try to explain my programs a little more modular as it can be confusing for others who aren't as advanced.
