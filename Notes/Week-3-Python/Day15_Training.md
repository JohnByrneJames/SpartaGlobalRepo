###### Sparta Global Training Day 15
###### Python starting...
___

> 9:00 AM Stand-up [Morning]

I am enjoying Python quite a lot, OOP is nothing new to me and I am actually enjoying going back over it.
It is great to see the power of Python coming to fruition and I really can't wait to carry on and see what else
this programming language is capable of. 

I have no blockers really, everything is going pretty well - the only blocker I have is that I keep
putting brackets around my everything as I am so used to using C-style syntax.


**One-to-One** with Sharukh<br>

**Agenda**
- We will time-box our meeting for 10 minutes
- Please take notes, as you will be expect to email us the summary of our conversations...
- How did you think this week went?
> **"** This week is going very well for me, I have enjoyed starting on Python I have quite a lot of enthusiasm for programming
>and finally getting into the technical part of the course. I am getting concepts and the more I try to program and encounter problem 
>the more I gradually learn about the language and its behaviours towards errors and its way of running. I have also enjoyed 
>messing around in the PyCharm IDE it is a brilliant resource. I really want to move onto doing more with Pythons capabilities such as
>its ease of accessing APIs, RESTful and speed of the process. So far I have to admit I have the most knowledge of OOP constructs I have had in
>a long time, the way it is taught here and reinforced through discussion and presentation is amazing for picking up the concepts.**"**
- From the behavioural competencies one competencies do you think you are excelling and which competencies you need to work one?
> **"** I have a lot of motivation at the moment for this course, I have a lot of enthusiasm to work on my Python as it could lead to a very 
>exciting career in DevOps  **"**
- One thing to start doing? 
> **"** I think I am still lacking on the communication aspect, I need to interact with my colleagues a little more and make myself
>known among my peers. I do already interact with my them a lot but I need to be consistent in the way I communicate with them. **"**
- One thing to stop doing? 
> **"** I need to try focus a little more on the class and do not get distracted my something else as I may be doing.   **"**
- One thing to continue?
> **"** Although I may already be familiar with a lot of the concepts such as OOP from previous programming in university it is
>important that I make myself into the best kind of learner I can be by making sure I fully understand everything.
> **"**

* **Positive feedback** <br>
 > **"** I have been engaged, showing a lot of enthusiasm for the Python subject that we have been learning, my logic and programming
>structure in my programs are well laid out and efficient. I have been engaged and asking questions where I need to and good explaining concepts. **"**

* **Constructive feedback** <br>
> **"** When doing homework I need to read the question first before jumping into it, before you try to further expand on the task do 
>everything that has been asked. Pseudo code my programs more as it is essential to understanding if you or anyone else ever refers
>back to the program in the future **"**

Thanks for the feedback I will take everything into consideration for sure and am looking forward to the next week. 

**Notes**
* **Self** - This is the part of a class that refers to that particular instance of that class, it
is usually used in a class initialisation to assign values to that instances attributes. 
* **Super** - This allows a sub-class (child class) to gain access to all the methods and attributes of its parent class.
