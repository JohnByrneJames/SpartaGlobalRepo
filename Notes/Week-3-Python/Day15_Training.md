###### Python starting...
___

> 9:00 AM Stand-up [Morning]





**One-to-One** with Sharukh<br>

**Agenda**
- We will time-box our meeting for 10 minutes
- Please take notes, as you will be expect to email us the summary of our conversations...
- How did you think this week went?
> **"** This week went very well for myself, it was constructive, informative and over all allowed us to 
>go through the information in a orderly fashion with the all important practical examples which drill the information
>that much more into your head. Astha is a really good teacher, she is calm, collected and always willing to help 
>anyone who thinks they do not understand what is needed to be done. At the time I felt like the course was going at a speed I 
>couldn't quite keep up with, but with my new 'Determined' and 'Successful' mind-set I managed to spend a good amount of time going 
>over each concept that I did not fully understand, this was displayed on the last day when I was breezing through the questions on the Mock-exam.  
>As for the weekend I will spend it going over SQL topics I am still not fully comfortable with such as `JOINS`,
>`CASE SELECT` and SubQueries.**"**
- From the behavioural competencies one competencies do you think you are excelling and which competencies you need to work one?
> **"** Like last week I think I am becoming more determined that I have ever been and really want to finish this course, with the best 
>possible outcome, therefore I am putting everything I have into making sure I have my notes formatted and uploaded by the end of the day 
>and pushing them to GitHub for easy access from any of my devices. I think I am improving on critical thinking and the way I convey
>information to my peers and supervisors but I still need to practice it a lot more, also I think my presentation skills need a lot 
>of work. This can only be achieved through presenting multiple times which I hope I will be doing many more times in the coming weeks. **"**
- One thing to start doing? 
> **"** Thinking about the way I formulate information and pass and receive information. Sometimes I find it hard to articulate questions 
>or a point I want to get across to others. **"**
- One thing to stop doing? 
> **"** Work on my presentation in the class, I was told that I have been laughing too much - therefore I will try to 
>dull it down but I refuse to look miserable all the time as I am enjoying the course and getting to know people so I want to express 
>my happiness towards that.**"**
- One thing to continue?
> **"** Keep up with the note-taking and interaction that I am giving in the classroom, clearly it is working as I have had a lot of positive 
>feedback from both Astha and Sharukh about my behaviour and involvement in the class **"**

* **Positive feedback** <br>
 > **"** Happy with performance throughout the class, able to keep up with everything and 
 ask questions whenever is needed, not afraid to admit when don't know something either. Overall am happy with
 progress so far...**"**

* **Constructive feedback** <br>
> **"** Do not Laugh during class... and do not eat (I have not eaten during class). It is 
 important to remain professional throughout the day and whenever you are learning as the classes are recorded and can be 
 viewed by anyone anytime from outside the class, as well as from people who join whilst we are having the class too. Before
 answering a question in the future make sure you read through the question twice before answering it, this way you 
 are less likely to miss information.**"**

Thanks for the feedback I will take everything into consideration for sure and am looking forward to the next week.
