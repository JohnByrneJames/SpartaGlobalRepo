###### Sparta Global Training Day 24
###### Project week, all this week so not much note taking and lots of collaborative programming
___
> 9:30 AM Sparta Stand-up [Morning]

We had a stand up this morning, All the groups went over their projects - I showed me flight creation system that the
assistant requested.

Today we have worked on the Airport Project, that has actually gone rather smoothly today apart from the database
which has remained incredibly flaky over the course of the day. Although this is not ideal we are DevOps that must work
through problems and so we carry on. I personally made code that was a skeleton and took the input. Luckily
for me it output the correct data that I expected.
