> 9:00 AM - Daily Stand Up **[Morning meetup]**

Discussing what we liked about yesterday and waht the highs and
blocks were of that day. 

- I enjoyed the fact that we learn about active listening and how
important it is to truely **LISTEN** and understand someones point.
This raises the point that it is positive to listen twice as much as
you talk. 

- I also enjoyed the **perato principle**, which is also known as the **80/20
principle** which says that everything is not as it seems or as it comes across.
For example in Italy; 80% of the population occupy only 20% of
the country. 

- I found that properly listening and using the concept of **active-listening** is
an essential part of being a good listener and can actively improve
every part of your business.

- What is **git** - it is a version control software that allows large projects to be
structurally saved throughout development and also help people work on different
parts of a project.
