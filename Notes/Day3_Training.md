> 9:00 AM - Daily Stand Up **[Morning meetup]**

Discussing what we liked about yesterday and waht the highs and
blocks were of that day. 

- I enjoyed the fact that we learn about active listening and how
important it is to truely **LISTEN** and understand someones point.
This raises the point that it is positive to listen twice as much as
you talk. 

- I also enjoyed the **perato principle**, which is also known as the **80/20
principle** which says that everything is not as it seems or as it comes across.
For example in Italy; 80% of the population occupy only 20% of
the country. 

- I found that properly listening and using the concept of **active-listening** is
an essential part of being a good listener and can actively improve
every part of your business.

> 9:10 AM - Install Git and PyCharm and create a GitHub Account **[Morning]**

- What is **git** - it is a version control software that allows large projects to be
structurally saved throughout development and also help people work on different
parts of a project. 

- **GitHub** is stored on the cloud and is available to be cloned to any machine at any time
in any place. 

* **Initializing the Repo**
    * First of all create the repo in the **GitHub** Repositories tab on **www.Github.com**,
    you **must** create a repository with the exact name as the folder you are using on your 
    local machine.
    * Create the Repository in **GitHub** and copy either the `HTTPS` or `SSH` git links for the 
    next step in create a remote repository.

> 12:30 PM - Afternoon Meeting with Richard **[Afternoon]**

- **Richard** is a Technical Delivery manager in Sparta Global and told a little about himself as well as 
answering some of our questions. I found out that he prefers **Command-Line** based Git rather than that
on a **GUI**.

> 12:45 PM - Afternoon Meeting with Richard **[Afternoon]**

In the **PyCharm** `Terminal` we are to enter some commands to initialise our Repo on the **local machine** and then
establish a **remote connection** with the Repository we just made.
* **Terminal :**
    * `init git` initialises the Repo on your local machine
    * `git add .` stages your files that are in the project
    * `git status` get the status of the files, whats stages and also view the changes that have been made.
    * `git commit -m "Your message"` commits the changes to the local machines **Repo**
    * `git remote add origin git@github.com:JohnByrneJames/com_3.git` The last part is the address of your **Repository**
    * `git push -u origin master` This will finalise the changes and push it to your remote copy on **GitHub** which will
    be saved to the **cloud** and can be accessed from anywhere!
