> 9:00 AM - Daily Stand Up **[Morning meetup]**

What was enjoyed about yesterday and any blockers. Yesterday we understood
the importance of listening and things like cognitive biases and the NLP that allow 
you to have a better mindset. It was nice to get to grips with using command-line based
Git as it allows for good practice that will probably be essential when going to work in 
a company later on.

**Morning Activity**

To be presented in the afternoon, create a presentation with your group to the following
questions, make sure it is informative and has a good layout.

* **Topic** - What are network diagrams in planning techniques (Not in technology)
    * **Tasks**
    * Task breakdown
    * Estimation of durations
    * Understand logical dependncies
    * Create network diagram
    * Gantt Chart
    
**Brief Research** - But rather than illustrating a physical network of servers and firewalls,
they can also depict how one task in a project connects to another task —
something that’s incredibly useful for managers.

Types of network diagram -: Precedence and Arrow Diagrams

- Represents activities in a project (prepare presentation) 
 
    - A **graphical representation** of all the **tasks, responsibilities and work-flow** for a project.
    It often looks like a chart with a series of boxes and arrows. ​
    - Maps out the **schedule and work-flow** of a project and helps track progress through each stage.
    - Encompasses every single action and outcome associated with **project, illustrates**
    scope of project.​
    - Techniques such as arrows can denote time depending on their length, arrow tail
    represents the start of an activity and the head represents the finish.​

> 10:05 AM - Looking at Interview techniques **[Mid-Morning]**

**Topic Interviewing** - 
    
* It is an important part of anyone's career as it is the part that you initially meet the employer in
what some may call a **high-pressure situation** as you need to represent yourself in the best light, including
selling yourself and showing them why they want to hire you. It is also helpful to prepare some research
that relates to their company as it can sometimes impress them if you know a little about them and what they do.

* display everything that is relevant to that particular job, tailor your CV to what is expected.
Include the required information such as **profile, formal-email address, employment history,**
interests or **extra-curricular activities**. Demonstrate your own skills in a way that shows you as
someone they want to hire. 

**Two-way** thing sometimes as you are actually interviewing the company, its your opportunity to grill them and Also
get them to sell themselves to you as well.  It can interesting for the employer if you prepare some questions from the
research done as it shows the employer you have shown an interest in their company and what kind of things you will be
doing in their company day-to-day.

**For example**
    
    - What project would I be working on?
    - How many are on the team?
    - What technology stack do you use? (AWS? AZURE GITLAB? GITBUCKET?)
    - what roles make up the team and how would you want me to fit into that?
    - How would I be on boarded to understand the systems you use?
    - Major challenges with the team?
    - What kind of social / team building activities do you do here?

**Answering Interview Questions**

Best way to articulate the questions that you are asked.

>**STAR** : `Situation`, `Task`, `Action` and `Result`

* Situation (`Set the scene`)
* Task (`Describe the purpose`)
* Action (`Explain what you did`)
* Result (`Share the outcome`)

> **Shows Passion** - **"** Have energy, show pride in what you do.**"**

**Typical Questions**
    
* **TMAY** - "Tell me about yourself"
* Strength / Weakness 
* Off the wall
* Why are you interested in role/ career choice?
* Technical knowledge

**Stories**

* Rehearse your story/ presentation 4 - 5 times because practice makes perfect
and the more times you go over potential questions the more comfortable you
would be if they came up.

> **"** Doesn't have to be the biggest achievement, think from their point of view and think What they
  want from me and what are they looking for... How did you behave in previous work placements or
  in the academy. Try to **turn weaknesses into strengths** that can be **taken advantage** of in them
  interview setting, can **highlight a weakness and demonstrate how you have continuously tried to better** that weakness **"**

**Elevator Pitch**
* Show you know what you're talking about
* Makes meeting people less awkward
* Makes you confident
* Four or five sentences, to the point
* Relevant info about you and your specialism
* Try and use it during the interview
* Don't just sell yourself, sell Sparta too - be excited about your own life and career prospects.

**Power Words** - think TRUMP (less offensive and provocative)
* `Successfully` `Energized` `Enthusiastic`
* `Intrested` `Love` `Motivated` `Priority`
* `Priority` `Amazing` `Win-win`

**Activity** - Create a 5 minute elevator pitch.

**`PREPARE`** - **`PREPARE`** - **`PREPARE`** 

_What I came up with_..
> **"** Hi my name is John. Its very nice to see you all! I am a trainee at the Amazing
Sparta Global training academy with a focus in becoming a successful DEVOP engineer
with one of their many clients. I have several years of experience working with various
technologies such as C#, Game Engines, Cloud and Microservices gained from
Greenwich University where I recently graduated with a 1st Class degree with a focus
on computing. I find technology to be innovate and refreshing - and would love an
opportunity to put my expertise to the test at Sparta Global. **"**

**Feedback**
* Try add some personal achievement and something that happened outside of
technology before you continue about technology.
* Try divert your pitch towards a place
you are comfortable, and add some more casual examples.
    * **`Include Prague Apprenticeship`**
    * **`Include some casual situations`**
    * **`More power Words such as Amazing, Driven and Passionate`**
    * **`Include Personal interests and activities`**
    * **`Example of something you are currently excited about`**

**Things not to say**
- What are the benefits

* **Clear and concise** to point on what you are explaining
* It is okay to look at the slides but do not read off the slide for the **whole timeline**
* **Educate yourself** on the topic thoroughly as it can help later in explaining the topic because
  you will be well versed in the information just from pointers that are on your Slides
* Be **respectful and be confident** when presenting, show **passion and enthusiasm**

    * Lead-in
    * Content
    * Summary/ Review
* Conclusions 
* Summary 
* Any Questions

**If you are presenting** : Understand the audience, keep it simple (**KISS**).

diagrams and images.

**Feedback**
* Add a **Summary Slides**
* **Introduce yourself** and smoothly transition between slides by introducing your
  colleagues
* Put informative images and make sure they are not too complicated
* It is not **performed within the 5 minutes**, therefore it is important to give yourself time and
  **rehearse so you can time-box** your presentation. Otherwise you may give a bad impression.
* **Good arrangements of images** and text so it is more readable, and perhaps give more information
  as having small images on their own is that for a very experienced.
* Make sure images are **clear and not too small or bad quality**.

___
> 16:00 PM - Project Environment **[Late-Afternoon]**

**Objectives** - The project environment
* Understand the difference between **BAU (business as usual)** and project work
* Have a **clear understanding of a project life-cycle** and the use of models
* Be able to **clearly identify business roles** and their function within the project
  environment
* Apply methods to help you identify risk areas
* Be versed in essential knowledge

**BAU vs Project**
* **Projects** have to be completed within a specific time-frame whereas business-as-usual (BAU) activities
  are on-going, continuous tasks. A new system for example with have a start and finish, where as business
  as usual is something that takes place day to day everyday.
    * Uses lots of different task and the way it was performed and carried out.
    Complex and is different from project to project.
    * A project is unique and transient with a desired outcome
* **BAU** Business as usual is the normal execution of standard operations within an organisation
* **Examples** : In this class there is week 2 - SQL Database which is a project for that week, this will change and have timelines
  where as BAU will remain the same with a routine. Arrive at 9:00 stand-up, work, break ECT.
  
**Project Life Cycle**

`Initiation` → `Planning` → `Executing` → `Monitoring and Controlling` → `Closing`

**The Triple Constraint**
* Scope
    * `Time`
    * `Cost`
    * `Quality`
    
These go **hand in hand and affect** each-other as well, for example with more time to prepare
  a presentation they will then expect a better quality presentation. If the cost of a project
  is high then the quality of the project is expected to be high as a lot of money has gone into it and
  time put into it.
  
  _Not Relevant but interesting Info..._
  
 >**Example of Mono Architecture** : Netflix used monolithic architecture and that meant that their whole system went down
  as it was all reliant on each other. Microservices allow for small parts to work independently without
  coupling and allows them to exist without that reliance which can disadvantage systems.

**POPIT Model**

`People` → `Organisation` → `Process` → `Information technology (IT)`

* Benefits of managing your project well
* Prioritise resources in project management as this will allow it to be delivered on time
* Look for the correct resources, that will positively impact the project development
* Meet the deadline, not overrun on time or money and delivered to a quality that is expected
* Good delegation of work to peers, it can help the project advance faster. Do not take it all on.
* Knowing about risk in a project and dealing with that risk is essential and will help manage it.

**Off Topic** _Note(s)_
* **Auto-Scaling / High-availability** - Cloud availability in different part of the world so
if one goes down then you will have a fail-safe to take over and reduce downtime.

**Software Development Lifecycles**

> **"** The project life cycle encompasses all the activities of the project, while the systems development life cycle
focuses on realising the product requirements **"**

**Waterfall** - `System Requirements` → `Software Requirements` -> `Analysis` → `Program Design` → `Coding` → `Testing`
→ `Operations`

___

**_`PSEUDO CODE`_** - Used a lot in Analysis and program design as well as mapping requirements and is used to show to clients
as it displays the capabilities of a system in a way that is easy for non-technological individuals to understand

**V-Model**
* `Requirement Specification` -> `Acceptance Testing`
* `Functional specification` -> `System testing`
* `Technical Specification` -> `Integrating testing`
* `Program specification` -> `unit Testing`
