###### Starting Project this week, but first we are going to find out Quality Gate results.

> 9:30 AM Academy Stand up [Morning]

I had no blockers on the weekend when I was able to focus and do things at my own pace without the quality gate looming over me I was able to complete the End-to-End pipeline with Jenkins in about a day and half. I have no yet fully documented this pipeline but I will have that done by the end of this week for sure. The project can be found [**HERE**](https://github.com/JohnByrneJames/node_app)

**We are going to get our results for the Quality Gate by the end of today.**
