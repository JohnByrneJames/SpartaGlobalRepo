> 9:00 AM - Daily Stand Up **[Morning meetup]**

This morning we are doing our `SQL` test on **codingames**... 

**Stand up**... <br>
Yesterday was a good day as I had a lot of time to go over my work and see the way in which 
someone else had done the same question to achieve the same answer as I got. I am happy that I 
got a good score in the test. I done a lot of revision last night and am fairly confident in both the practical 
and theory part of the test. I have lots of experience to pull from and I need to apply my full focus on the 
test for the best result.

**Blockers**...<br>
I am personally not feeling many blockers at the moment, I feel like I have grasped the basic concepts 
of sub-queries but not to a degree where I could use them from memory and would most likely use a `JOIN` statement
instead. I just need to invest more time in the future to learn sub-queries further, however as I am not
confident I am gonna try to refrain using them as much as I can.
