###### Sparta Global Training Day 12
###### Finish of SQL week by doing test then continuation on with Python

> 9:00 AM - Daily Stand Up **[Morning meetup]**

This morning we are doing our `SQL` test on **codingames**... 

**Stand up**... <br>
Yesterday was a good day as I had a lot of time to go over my work and see the way in which 
someone else had done the same question to achieve the same answer as I got. I am happy that I 
got a good score in the test. I done a lot of revision last night and am fairly confident in both the practical 
and theory part of the test. I have lots of experience to pull from and I need to apply my full focus on the 
test for the best result.

**Blockers**...<br>
I am personally not feeling many blockers at the moment, I feel like I have grasped the basic concepts 
of sub-queries but not to a degree where I could use them from memory and would most likely use a `JOIN` statement
instead. I just need to invest more time in the future to learn sub-queries further, however as I am not
confident I am gonna try to refrain using them as much as I can.

:star: Got **97%** :star: on **SQL Test**

Finishing with the final SQL-Test and preparing for Python module to start by going though the [**W3Schools Python**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp)
course

Created Python Cheatsheet ~ [**HERE**](/Notes/Python-Intro-Week-3/W3Schools-Python-CheatSheet.md) 

Created Version of SQL Mini-Project Summary ~ [**HERE**](/Documents/SQL-Mini-Project-Summary-NoMarks.pdf)

> 1:30PM - Profiling Workshop with Astha **[Afternoon]**

Two documents `Extensive Profile` and `SpartaGlobal Profile`
* [JohnByrneSpartaGlobalProfile](/Documents/JohnByrneSpartaGlobalProfile.docx)
* [JohnByrneEngineering67SummaryProfile](/Documents/JohnByrneEngineering67SummaryProfile.pptx)

**Objectives**
* You will be more self-aware from different perspectives
* You will understand how to write a better summary
* You will understand the difference between skills and behaviour

There are the 5 Strengths test and this can help you produce a good piece of information for your strengths 
as well as assist in writing your summary in the profile. 

It is better to have **60%** Hard Skills and **40%** Soft Skills as I am a technical person and it can sometimes be more 
desired by employers. Especially for employers of Devops.

* behaviour and value in summary (`hard-worker`, `Creativity`, `Speaking`)

* skills go in skills section (`time-management`, `teamwork`, `planning`, `remote-working`)
    * Have Strong skills that are really wanted and include other aspects such as responsibility and enthusises these aspects.
    * Software (`GitHub`, `Azure Data Studio`, `PyCharm`, `Visual Studio`) - Languages (`C#`, `SQL`, `Python`)
    
* Transferable Skills
    * Initiative
    * Planning
    * Teamwork
    * Communication 
    * Problem-solving
    * Can be many more.... (Not only Tech - Customer facing role ECT.,)
    
**Summary** It could be good to show off your university degree and what you did for your final year project

**Tips for Profile**
* Use **Justify** lining with clean edges
* Talk in **Third-Person** throughout
* For employment history **bullet-points** are much more preferable in this section as it is much more readable
* In certifications add **diploma** and other technical and non-technical certifications achieved.
* Write hobby in short, make sure it is something recent with one or two lines about it.
* Add folder that contains profiles in `.gitignore` so it cannot be seen through GitHub
* Add Profile and stuff into a folder inside the SpartaGlobal OneDrive and then right click and Share, then share that link 
with your trainer so they can review it through the link. 
* Someone is expected to be the **Profile Co-ordinator**
