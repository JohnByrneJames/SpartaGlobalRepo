###### Sparta Global Training Day 13
###### Python starting...
___

> 9:00 AM Stand-up [Morning]

Yesterday was good, I learned a lot about what makes a good profile for the clients to view and why
it is important to work hard in making an attractive and summarise yourself to attract them. Python 
variables is nothing new to me and they are very similar to other languages like C#, C++, Java and JavaScript.

**Blockers..** I have no blockers from yesterday. 

**Question** : In Python, a variable must be declared before it is assigned a value.
<br>**Answer** : Variables need not be declared or defined in advance in Python. To create a variable, you just assign it a value

We are done, now to the [**Trello**](https://trello.com/b/eZdQiVQU/engineering-67) board to update the Week Sprint and Doing/ Done.

* **Today's Objectives**
    * **Data Types**
    * **Lists and Tuples**
    * **Concatenation**

> 10:15 AM Python Variables, Data types and operators [Mid-Morning]
    
## Data Types and Operators

| Operand | Description                                                | Example |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **>**       | True if left operand is greater than the right             | x > y   |
| **<**       | True if left operand is less than the right                | x < y   |
| **==**      | True if both operands are equal                            | x == y  |
| **!=**      | True if both operands are qual                             | x != y  |
| **>=**      | True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right | x >= y  |
| **<=**      | True if left operand is less than or equal to the right    | x <= y  |
Here we are comparing the two variables, therefore it will return `FALSE` because **10** is not equal to **11**.
```python
x = 10 
y = 11 

print(x == y)
```

Here we are comparing two variables, therefore it will return `TRUE` because **10** is not equal to **11**.
```python
x = 10
x = 11

print(x != y)
```

... The rest are quite straight forward... and can be found in greater detail in my [**Python Cheatsheet**](W3Schools-Python-CheatSheet.md)
