###### Sparta Global Training Day 11

___

> 9:00 AM - Daily Stand Up **[Morning meetup]**

**Astha** and **Sharukh** gone to training meeting so we are revising for databases until 9:30
when they are back.

- We went over the questions in the mini-project to compare what answers we got. No one exchanged 
answers only tips of what to do.

**Blockers** and stuff I **enjoyed** about last week and the weekend.

I spent a while on the project over the weekend, I have finished the project now but I 
found the last question specifically a little bit mind boggling. It specifically was not 
something I had seen before and I only got it through multiple attempts. I couldn't 
get it formatted in a way that showed the month as a name and year as a number using the format
as I think it converts it to a `VARCHAR`. 

| DML    | DDL      | DCL    | TCL       |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| `SELECT` | `CREATE`   | `GRANT`  | `COMMIT`    |
| `INSERT` | `ALTER`    | `REVOKE` | `ROLLBACK`  |
| `UPDATE` | `DROP`     |          | `SAVEPOINT` |
| `DELETE` | `TRUNCATE` |          |           |

**Re-Iteration** of table for revision.
