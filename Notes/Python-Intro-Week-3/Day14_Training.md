###### Sparta Global Training Day 13
###### Python starting...
___

> 9:00 AM Stand-up [Morning]

Yesterday was quite enjoyable for me, I have always been looking forward to getting into the world 
python and yesterday was the first proper day we started to comb over the concepts of the interpreted language.
As I have used other languages in the past I have noticed small differences in the syntax and the reduced need for constant 
instruction, instead Python will attempt to interpret everything you are trying to achieve in the program. It is clear to see 
why it is such a powerful and widely used language and I am looking forward to getting more and more into it 
particularly the advanced concepts such as functions and the object oriented programming. Good pace, just fast enough.

# Concepts of Object oriented programming
* **Abstraction**
* **Encapsulation** 
* **Polymorphism** 
* **Inheritance** 

Analogy..

Some people find it basic but relates to all of us.
