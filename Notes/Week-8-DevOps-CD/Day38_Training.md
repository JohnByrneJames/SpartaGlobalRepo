> 9:30 AM - 10:00 AM Self-revision and Standup [Morning]

Today we are starting on Jenkins with Filipe, but first we had a stand up. I personally had no blockers yesterday apart from the fact
that my laptop is not able to run the virtual machine software using Vagrant. Therefore I have got my big computer and
am going to set that up later tonight when I have more time.
