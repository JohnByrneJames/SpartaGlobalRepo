> 9:30 AM - 10:00 AM Stand up [Morning]

We looked at our usual blockers and good moments from yesterday and then we went onto
prepare for our presentations which we are having at 10:00 AM once we have rehearsed within our
groups.

> 10:00 AM Presentations [Morning]

We did the presentation, it went well and I think we got the information across in a good time
as we were time-boxed for 10 minutes. We presented from 10:20 - 10:30.

Luckily we do not need the Virtual Machine to be working at the moment, however it is important that it does work - So I plan to restart
my computer from factory settings later on in the evening. The presentation can be found [**HERE**](../../Documents/Presentation_CI_CD_CDE.pptx)
