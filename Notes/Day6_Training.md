> 9:00 AM - Daily Stand Up **[Morning meetup]**

**Blockers** and **Good Points** from last week that you remembered.

Look forward to starting this week on SQL as I prefer more **technical orientated** courses and I hope to
learn stuff that I do not already know about SQL as I know a bit but am not fully able to use 
every essential part of the **software and database** work. This week I am going to go try a new note 
taking technique, instead of writing it out on **ATOM** and then re-writing it in **markdown** after the lesson 

I am going to write down the notes straight into **PyCharm** as it wil allow me to focus more on notes and 
spend less time rewriting it and more just quickly **re-formatting and proof-reading** it at the end.

**Astha** told us that she cannot see us getting exams on friday this week due to the backlog of work to be done 
in SQL, it is a decision for the group to take.

> 9:30 AM - 11:00 AM - Last half hour revision and Business week test **[Mid-Morning]**

Test took me 20 Minutes to complete and was 65 Questions long
   
   * Things to Learn from this test:
        * Think before you answer, make sure you fully read the question before submitting your answer 
        * Sometimes business models can be interpreted in slightly different ways, use initiative to overcome
        * When revising it is important to make stuff a little more memorable, with acronyms you remember 
        * Each question has a time limit of 1 minute

Result `75%` (Good, but definitely could do better ~)

> 11:00 AM - Meeting with Sales Team and Data  **[Mid-Morning]**

The Sales team are the ones that get us interviews and set up the opportunities for us.
The people we met were Cindy Sharman and Tim McCharthy 

A lot of the clients use sparta to build up permanent staff.
* **Road map** :
    * `Day 1 on site`
    * `Month 6 probation review` - Areas that need support 
    * `Month 12 performance and pay review` - Another review and payrise potentially
    * `Month 18 Conversion discussion` - The client will then say they really want this person
    * `Month 24 client conversion` - Hopefully there is a handshake where you join that academy
    * `Future leader`
    
* **Q&A**
    * Trying to broaden their client base to places around the world, other than the UK. 
    * The **pre-assignment** window **3 months**, you will be available for all and any interviews 
    that may come up. It is encouraged that you get some kind of work or part-time work during that time.
    * Some of the **projects** you get assigned to are short-handed  but a lot of them after long-term these days. 
    * **"** Be open-minded about where you go as sometimes it is not as you think, if you don't try something how can you 
     find what you like. **"**
    * The **spartans** that have done research on that company they are usually the ones that get the job, always look up 
    the client and what they do; they want you to know what they do.
    * Look them up on **linkedIN** and ask them their history ECT. ~ **Have Questions...**
    * Be honest, if you are asked something you don't know then it is okay to say you don't know about it,
    happy to research it though. `Honesty` and `Integrity`.
    * **Quality Gates** can also assess how likely you are to be chosen for an interview.
    * **90-second** elevator pitch for why you are interested in tech.

> 12:00 PM - Starting SQL with Astha  **[Afternoon]**

Starting the SQL learning week... We will be using Azure Data Studio for this.

**Structured Query Language** **(SQL)** test is 20% is Theory, 80% is coding [**Open-Book** Exam]

**Presentation topics** 
*   Joins and Hands-on-joins
*   Group by having and hands on

**SQL Commands** ~ things covered

* `SELECT * FROM Employees` This selects all the employees from that particular table `BAD PRACTICE IN INDUSTRY`

> **"** It is always good practice to use good coding conventions such as all capital **SELECT** for SQL
> key words **"**

* `SP_HELP Employees` Shows you the structure of the tables 

___

> 13:50 PM - Going through Database introduction  **[Mid-Afternoon]**

**Objectives**
* Understand database terminology
* Build an SQL database
* Insert some common data types into the database 
* List various database tools in common use 
* Compare and explain the different database structures 
* Explain a simple relational database structure

A **Database** is a collection of data where you store the data in organised tables and columns with various 
types and can be accessed in various ways.

These can be used through things known as **Database Management Studio** **(DBMS)**, these allow us to manipulate and play with the data in ways 
we need to. **Relational Database** is a database where the tables have different kinds of relationships, it adds structure 
to your database and allows access to data much more easy.

> **"** We must be able to structure tables to contain the right type of information, so that we can query it **"**

**Database** tables have **attributes** that are used to label data, for example **Name** will contain the names and **Birthday** will 
contain the date of birth of each of these users.

**Columns** contain the attributes below the name of each label. **Rows** contain information on a single individual or asset,
for example "John", "29", "Mr.", "Marital Status" ECT.. Also known as **Records** and **Tuples**

* `USE 'DatabaseName'` This is useful to manually connect to different databases

**Tables** are predefined formats of rows and columns that define an entity. Also known as a file. An **entity** is something 
we want to model and store information about, for example a customer.

> **"** It is important to give **Tables** and **Columns** meaningful names, do NOT be ambiguous  **"**

**Meeting with Sharukh**

Well, everything was delivered with good quality and depth into what is needed for that
topic. The amount of communication between the group was nice as it allowed for everyone to keep up
especially as everyone showed a lot of patience waiting for the stragglers during the GitHub day. This
makes it look positive as the Python will be more coding and it will hopefully go this well.

I personally think I am excelling at being determined, I make sure that I focus and listen every part of the class with my full attention
and take notes on almost all of the parts. After every lesson I take an hour to re-write my notes to a markdown file in GitHub which
helps me rehearse what I have learned that day, I am very motivated to succeed at this course, I plan to endure it and am
positive about it.

**One thing I need to start doing?** 

Start allowing myself to be a little more open and interact more with people.

Sharukh said that he does not think I am not contributing, I speak up when needed and get involved 
enough, such is required.

**One thing to stop doing?**

Try to be more of a critical thinker about questions as it can help answer questions in a more
interesting way and professional way.

Here I was told that it is not enough to just say I want to be a critical thinker, it is also required that you 
provide a way that you are going to improve and am currently using that improve. I was told that SMART objectives are 
useful for this.

**What does SMART stand for**

* **S**PECIFIC
* **M**EASUREABLE
* **A**CHIEVABLE
* **R**EALISTIC
* **T**IMEBOUND

**One thing to stop doing?**

Carry on with what I am doing and make sure I keep my determination and focus up, I should also help others 
for example since I have background in computing use this to help others 
with useful tips.

**positive**
75% is a very good score considering allt he information - Want to see practical implementation 
and display that work. 

**Be focused** in the class. If you feel like you cannot find an answer yourself, then ask - if you cannot google it do it, then 
ask afterwards as it can help advance problem solving. Use documentation to help see how they
have implemented, improve problem solving.

**Activity** Breaking down Table into tables that are expected

* Make sure you keep your IDs unique and do not keep columns that can exist on their own.

**Primary Key** - Tables unique ID

**Foreign Key** - Different tables ID

**Types of Databases**
* Flat-file Database
    * Stores everything in one table. Good for small number of records related to one topic.
* Relational Database
    * Gives you the ability to seperate masses of data into numerous tables.
    * They are linked to each other through the use of keys.
* Big Data
    * MongoDB, Vertica etc...
    * Used for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence
    * Digital Age and Internet of Things
    
**Exercise** Example of column names :

**Table_books** 
* Book_ID **(Primary Key)**
* Published date
* Booked title
* Author
* LibraryIndex
* ISBFCode

**Table_library_patron**
* Patron_ID **(Primary Key)**
* First Name
* Last Name
* Donation band
* Member since

**Table_bank_account**
* Account_ID **(Primary Key)**
* First Name
* Surname
* Amount
* Account Number
* Pin Number

**Primary Keys** should never be changed, therefore it is good to just give it a 
unique ID such as **BOO928**, could be auto generated so that no two keys are the same.

**Foreign Keys** are links to other databases that hold more information 
about particular entities.

**Relational Databases**

**relationship Types**
* **One-to-One**
> **Employee ID**, **FirstName**, **LastName**
>           
> **NHS ID** _`(One employee has one nhs ID)`_

Each row in table A is linked to no more than one row in table B. This is an attribute 
of the relationship not the tables. A student may have one row in the Contact info table.

* **One-to-Many**
> **Employee ID**, **FirstName**, **LastName**
>           
> **Passport** _`(One employee can have many passports)`_
 
> **CustomerID, FirstName, LastName**
>
> **purchase IDs** _`(One customer can have many purchases)`_

Each row in the table can related to many rows in the relating table

This allows frequently used infromation to be saved only once in a table and referenced 
many times in other tables.

* **Many-to-Many**
> **StudentsID, FirstName, LastName**
>
> **CourseID** 
>
>_`(Many Students can enroll on many courses)`_
>
>_`(Many Courses can have many students)`_

One or more rows in a table can be related to 0, 1 or many rows in anotehr table. A 3rd table called a mapping or 
link table is required to implement such a relationship. For example 
customers can purchase many products.

For the **Many-To-Many** you need to insert a conjunction table that will take 
both keys from each table and make sure of composite primary keys, this breaks this into two **One-To-Many** relationships. keys that are chosen 
to be a primary key are among the **Candidate keys** and are up to the designer which one is chosen. 

**Primary Key**
* Simple 
* Compound/ Composite Key

**Foreign Key**
* More than one
* Point to the primary key of another table

**Candidate Keys**
* Columns that can guarantee uniqueness
* For a customer table **Cust_Id** would be a good candidate key, however so would **Cust_Number** 
but it is up to the designer to make the decision.

**Composite Keys**
* A key that has more than one attribute is known as a **composite key**,
 it is also known as a **compound key**. 

| cust_Id | order_Id | product_code | product_count |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| C01     | O001     | P007         | 23            |
| C02     | O123     | P007         | 19            |
| C02     | O123     | P230         | 82            |
| C01     | O001     | P870         | 42            |
> **"** None of these columns can play a role of key in this table (This typically happens in **Many-to-Many** Relationships) **"**

Column **cust_Id** alone cannot become a key as a customer can place **many** orders, thus the same customer can have multiple entries.

Column **order_Id** alone cannot become a primary key as a same order can contain the order of **many** products, thus same **order_Id** can be present multiple times.

Column **product_code** cannot be a primary key as **many** customer can place orders for the same product.

Column **product_count** alone cannot be a primary key because **many** orders can be placed for the same product.

**For this example** it is safe to assume that the key should be one have more than one attribute, therefore 
{**`cust_Id`** and **`product_code`** } is the **composite key** as it is made up of more than one attributes.

**Homework**

* ~~Look into composite keys, these are keys that can have more than one. It happens between tables 
that have a **Many-to-Many** relationship.~~ 
* ~~Rewrite the slides from the Primary and Foreign key in the recording from today's  work.~~
* Prepare for a presentation on `Grouping and having + hands-on`
    * Group made up of: **Myself**, **sohaib** and **Lucio**
    
**Group By** and **Having Clause**

* **Group By** Clause, is a tool used in SQL to **summarise** or **aggregate**. It is a good way to perform data summarisation 
and is very helpful for **Analyst's** to create a visualisation, conclude findings, and report writing.

* **Pseudo code** 

`SELECT column_name(s)`

`FROM table_name`

`WHERE condition`

`GROUP BY column_name(s)`

* **Example in Azura Database Studio**

`SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), City`

`FROM Customers`

`GROUP BY City`

* **Having Clause** is used to filter the **grouped** records. Having clause returns the grouped records which match the given condition. You can also sort the grouped 
records which using **Order By**. 

* **Pseudo code** 

`SELECT column_name(s)`

`FROM table_name`

`WHERE condition`

`GROUP BY column_name(s)`

`HAVING condition`

`ORDER BY column_name(s)`

* **Example in Azura Database Studio**

`SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), City`

`FROM Customers`

`GROUP BY City`

`HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 2`

> **"** An example of this is to sum up the daily sales and combine in a single quarter and show it to the senior manager. **"**
