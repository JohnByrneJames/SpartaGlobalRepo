The first part of the morning is spent in our groups doing my project work, this is followed by the Academy Stand, which is a
stand up held by Richard and allows all the groups to meet each other, with 1 representative explaining what we have been doing this week.

During Academy Stand up I was shouted out as star trainee of the week for getting 100% in the Python test.
