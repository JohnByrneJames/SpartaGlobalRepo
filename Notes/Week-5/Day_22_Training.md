###### Project week, all this week so not much note taking and lots of collaborative programming
___

> 9:00 AM Stand-up [Morning]

We went over our scrum boards this morning as we are starting an airport project this week.

* **RULES**

* Git hub links shared on Engineering 67 every morning
* SCRUM master to talk through scrum board every day (rotating)
* Tea break at 11:00 - 11:15 / Tea break 2 at 15:00 to 15:15
* Lunch 12:30 to 13:30 unless instructed otherwise

Some tips for Extending the Airport Projects:
* Look in real life situations
* If baby (0 - 24 months) then no seat taken, they will sit on parents lap. 40% of parent value.
* 2 - 12 years = 50% of the price but given a seat.

We started work on the [**Entity Relationship Diagram**](https://app.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/3fdc4d3b-7de1-404a-896d-9e13922574c2)
