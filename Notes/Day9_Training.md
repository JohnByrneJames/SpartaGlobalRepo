###### Sparta Global Training Day 9
###### Continuing with SQL and presenting on `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
___

> 9:00 AM - Daily Stand Up **[Morning meetup]**

Things that I enjoyed from yesterday as well as the blockers from yesterday.

**Enjoy** ... I enjoyed learning about the wildcards **%** **_** as they are useful 
for finding data based on a set of conditions and not exact search terms. I can see how 
this would be useful in industry whilst doing querying.

**Blockers** ...
Need to go over some `DELETE CASCADE` a little more as well as 
go over **DDL**, **DML**, **DCL** and **TCL**. I need to know the **DDL** and **DML** off by 
heart so that in the future I can easily serve that information if ever asked in the future.

At the end of the graduation at Sparta Global there will be a presentation given to 
all of Sparta Global, Sales Team and students. **PREPARE** and research their interests and 
technology they are using.
