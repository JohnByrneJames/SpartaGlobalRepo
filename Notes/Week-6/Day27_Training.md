> 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM Stand-up [Morning]

The presentations were good but I don't think I did what my best and definitely need to work on a lot of points,
particularly conveying information in a way that is understandable. The day went rather quick and I was a little
behind when it came to the interview. I found out a lot of stuff about myself, including a lot of stuff I need to work on.
Including **STAR** in all my replies is vital.

I found it hard to recall examples to use in my responses so I need to perhaps make a cheat sheet of questions and answers
so I have those answers before the interviewer even asks the question.
