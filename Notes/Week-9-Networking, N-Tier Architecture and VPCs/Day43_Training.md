###### Sparta Global Training Day 43
###### Continuing with VPC and Networks

> 9:30 AM Academy Stand up [Morning]

The lecturers were in their meeting this morning so we started our Stand up at 9:30, 
yesterday was a flurry of information and was actually quite
exciting as it is information that is quite new to me in terms of the depth that
it was taught. It is quite amazing how networks are designed and everything kind of 
goes hand in hand.

I don't really have any blockers but I really need to start revising on them. I will continue to make diagrams and make README as this is a good way to drill in the information that we learnt.
