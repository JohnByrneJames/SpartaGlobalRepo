###### Sparta Global Training Day 44
###### Looking at the Node App on our VPC public subnet instance and 
___

> 9:00 AM Academy Stand up [Morning]

I have no blockers, I have the app working on my VPC App instance. It works as expected with a weird host error but still runs the node app and I am able to connect to it. I will keep the error in mind and try resolve it later on once I have my current set up fully documented so that if I need to I can easily refer back to it.

**Today** we may have **Interviews**. These are only mocks but they are still quite important and may involve a lot of important information that will be asked in the real ones.

**We Have been tasked to create a DEMO VIDEO**:

It can be seen on this [**card**](https://trello.com/c/M0to4ePp/207-making-small-demo-videos) on the trello. This can be recorded and shown to the client later.

**Difference between**

**Private and Public Subnet**: Private has no internet and public has acess to the internet.
