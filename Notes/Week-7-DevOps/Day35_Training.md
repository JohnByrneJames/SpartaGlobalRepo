###### Sparta Global Training Day 35
###### Continuation of Vagrant and Oracle VM box

---

> 9:30 AM - 10:00 AM Self-revision and Standup [Morning]

Yesterday was very unproductive for myself but I did a lot of in terms of debugging and testing
for any issues, however it came to a bit of a halt as I was tired and decided to leave it until today.
I am going to try get to the bottom of this today, so I can at least get the DOD done for Shahrukh on monday.

I am also going to be pre-formatting the documentation that will be in the repository of my app too.

# Welcome to the Documentation of how to set up a multi-machine environment within Oracle VM using Vagrant.

_Summary_ This documentation will guide you step by step on how to set up and configure a multi-machine environment capable of
hosting a app made with Javascript and a database that is connected to the app in a separate virtual machine using MongoDB.

By The end of this you should be able to run the `app.js` file inside the app VM and connect to the website `development.local` via
your preferred browser, without a need for any port such as `3000`. The default port for the server hosting software **NGINX** is
`80` therefore we are also going to be implementing what is known as a reverse proxy to change that port to redirect the user to the
website which will be listening on port `3000`.
