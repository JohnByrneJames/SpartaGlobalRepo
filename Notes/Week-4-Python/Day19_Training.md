###### Sparta Global Training Day 19
###### Covering some more python concepts today to nail in concepts, database with python

___

> 9:00 AM Stand-up [Morning]

yesterday was good for me I did not have many problems, I think it is a little easier for myself
as I have done this before in a different language so I have a better
grasp of concepts. I am more than happy to go over work again though as it is
important that everyone is caught up. The mock is a great idea but I would prefer
the exam friday obviously but it is down to majority, I am happy to go at a pace that everyone is
satisfied with otherwise it isn't a team effort and that is what we are doing here at the moment.

- Question
    * What exceptions would be raised if you were to do '10/ 0' `DivideByZeroError`
    * What exceptions would be raised if you were to do 'Print("Description" + 2)' `TypeError`
    
Richard came in and gave us a talk, he particularly said we should practice on sites like:
[**CodeWars**](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard)

**Database Module** with Astha
* This is how to handle the data we get in Python and manage it into a DBMS

We discussed what we should do in terms of learning databases, it was decided we would actually
begin by going step by step but incorporate examples and examples.

We have worked on a database connection, in this directory [**Database-connection**](../../Python-Files/Database-Connection)

**UI** - user interface E.G. Front-end

**UX** - user experience E.G. how can you provide it to increase their experience

Here we are going to establish a connection and read data from the database in the python console, this is
important because it is what they do in the real world. This allows us to showcase data from a database in real-time which 
 we would display to the front-end, E.G. the UI interface for users. As they will NEVER have access directly to the database or its data.

~~ The class had **MANY** errors! ~~~

I just practiced SQL querying while waiting around, it is what it is. 

We are going to present our design of our project, or stuff we have learned in one big project.
