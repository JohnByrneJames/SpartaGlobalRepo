###### Sparta Global Training Day 20
###### Mock test, revising python for test on monday morning and also creating a OOP program to demo at 3:00 to everyone

___

> 9:00 AM Stand-up [Morning]

Yesterday we learnt about database usage through the Python module known as `Pyodbc` overall it was a good day,
but we did not get as much done as we were supposed to as a lot of the students in the class had a lot of
problems with getting the connection to successfully connect, and before that the Mac users particularly had to reinstall
something called Home-brew as well as the C++ compiler before they were able to download the module.

I have no blockers really, except that when I was practicing last night the module was very flaky,
in terms of the way it returns the data, like the table names and column names, there is no order that it is returned which
is very frustrating as I want to create a dictionary with the entire databases structure.

We now have a to revise now for the mock - I will also be working on the program to present at the end of the day.
I plan to make a interactive program that allows a user to specify what kind of query they want to carry out based on their user
input. This will incorporate reading/ writing, databases, OOP, static methods, encapsulation, and exceptions inside loops
to allow the user to not be throw out or shown an error if they fail to enter the correct input. The best way to think when designing
for a user is to think _`"what ever can go wrong will go wrong"`_.

**Agenda**

**Elevator Pitch**
>**"** 
> Hi I am John, its so nice to meet you! I'm a trainee at SpartaGlobal with a focus in DevOps where I attend classes 9 - 5, 
> monday to Friday, this taking place virtual of course due to the recent circumstances. I attend daily SCRUM meetings 9 - 9:30 and
>am using all the latest and greatest technologies including SQL-Server, Python and GitHub to extensively grow my employability and personal
>skills. I am recent graduate from the University of Greenwich, with a focus on Computing and Games Development which included hands-on
>experience with a magnitude of programming languages and software, such as C#, C++, Microsoft Management Studio and the latest Game-Engines. 
> 
>   I find the speed at which your company as adapted to the current epidemic climate amazing!, being able to expand your services following a huge demand
>and presumably lack of staff is innovating and impressive. Particularly the fact you have been able to move most of the services to a virtual platform, Incredible!.
> I'd love the opportunity to put expertise to work in your company. Thank you for the opportunity, if possible would it be possible to set up a quick call whenever you are next free
>to talk about any upcoming opportunities on your teams? 
>
>Thank you for the opportunity, and the time to tell you a bit about myself.

- We will time-box our meeting for 10 minutes
- Please take notes, as you will be expect to email us the summary of our conversations...
- How did you think this week went?
>**"** This week went relatively well I thought, there was a lot of content that I was eager to get into, such as the reading/writing with files
>, API, exception handling, database connections and a lot more that I plan to look into in my own time like the PANDAS module which allows
>data manipulation. I think Ibrahim told me about that. 
>
>However, I do think the week went a little slow and at times we definitely lagged behind but
>it is what it is and I don't think it could have been done any quicker as some people had problems that were quite unique. I think that I am actually quite
>proficient at Python personally and I can work out a lot of exercises that are given, I am able to carry out program design without constantly
>referring to the internet and I am enjoying it. This probably comes from my past experience with C#, C++ and Java.
>
>Overall I was please with how the week went I feel like I have added another solid layer of knowledge to myself and made
>notes that will be able to back the learning in the future in case any of the concepts slip my mind.
>**"**
- From the behavioural competencies one competencies do you think you are excelling and which competencies you need to work one?
>**"**   Following on from the past two weeks of one-to-ones I feel like I have mastered the determination and am fully
>committed to this training, I am to go all the way as I feel very confident at the moment in my own ability and don't feel like
>I am behind or going to fall behind. I feel like I need to work on my analytical and managerial competencies, I choose these because
>when I do a task I have been just doing it, up until last one-to-one when you said to plan it out using pseudo-code which is actually
>an amazing idea!! 
>
>I have tried it but still need to work on it, the ability to analyse an exercise in a holistic way and then step-by-step plan it
>out in pseudo code so I can complete each section bit by bit, and the ability to manage myself as I get too excited with more
>functionality that could be added and start to go off track very early which is a bad use of time. Get the base done first then add the extra
>functionality is my new work ethic.
>**"**
- One thing to start doing? 
>**"**  Start planning before doing, make use of the time I have and make sure it is in the most efficient way possible. I know it said one
>but I also need to work on my presentation skills, although I don't hate it and I think I did well considering I have not done
>much presenting at all. Just small bits here and there and I will be ready to become the best presenter I can be.
>**"**
- One thing to stop doing? 
>**"**  Stop over-complicating exercises and just life in general, look at the here and now instead of what it could be or what I can do to improve it,
>that will come later once the base exercise/ situation has been achieved otherwise things will take more time and probably
>cause more issues. 
>**"**
- One thing to continue?
> **"** Keep up the interaction with peers and tutors as it helps build good relationships which are always important in any organisation, or
>situation. I always refrain from answering a question that I know as I want to give someone else a chance to answer it, then I will answer if it
>seems like no one else knows.
> **"**

* **Positive feedback** <br>
>**"** 
>Technical ability, contributions and adaptability to new concepts is very good and always on point with the class.
>**"**

* **Constructive feedback** <br>
>**"** 
> Got profile in late, this delays the whole class unfortunately and is going to be bad for your image in the company.
> Attention to detail, if something is asked do that task then expand on it (this was acknowledged)
>
>In Elevator pitch do not read from somewhere it is mechanical, also speak with your diaphragm. 
>**"**

**Research**

I researched the diaphragm afterwards and found this excellent description of what it is.
>**"** Here's an easy way to tell the difference.
>
>Try speaking to yourself in a very low volume, mumble like you're almost humming. If you pay attention, you'll notice a sensation like a vibration coming from behind your jaw.
>
>Now, take a deep breath, open your mouth widely, and yell a sound while exhaling forcefully, like "ha" or "hey", as if you want someone far away to hear you in a large crowded area. You may notice that your skull seems to be vibrating less than before. You may also have the sensation that the voice came from deeper within you, instead of your general throat area.
>
>The first one was you speaking from the throat. The second was speaking from the diaphragm.
