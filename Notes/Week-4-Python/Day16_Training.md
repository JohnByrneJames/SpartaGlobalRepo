> 9:00 AM Stand-up [Morning]

We had a stand up this morning, it went well I answered the question of how to
implement encapsulation into a class, this is done by making methods/ attributes of that
class private. This makes them hidden to anything that is trying to access them outside
of the class. Unfortunately there is ways to get around that, and access it through a name mangling process.
Ultimately privatisation is not really a thing in python instead it relies on respectable developers
to follow the conventions of keeping them private.

There is also a way to implement a technique known as a getter and setter method, through something
called the `property()` function, this allows the altercation of private variables whilst keeping data
integrity.

> 11:00 AM Stand-up [Late-Morning]

Started working on python TTD testing, this is in a separate Repo. <br>
This repo can be found here [**Python_ttd_pytest**](https://github.com/JohnByrneJames/python_tdd_pytest)

> 13:40 PM Lunch [Afternoon]

Today we were to complete the research we had carried out over the weekend and implement them into 4 repositories each with a
respected pillar of OOP programming, these were all creates in different repositories to further enforce the process
that is carried out in GitHub to set up and push to Repositories. This is good practice as GitHub is heavily used in industry
and this will be invaluable experience for our future as DevOps.

We also created individual presentations that demonstrated our elevator pitch, and the understanding we have of these 4 OOP
concepts with examples in PyCharm along with explanations. My presentation was taken well as Sharukh
said I had good understanding and excellent logical explanation of the concepts - I was also not made to redo the presentation as some
Unfortunately were.
* The presentation can be downloaded here [**Presentation_on_OOP**](../../Documents/Presentation_OOP_Individual.pptx)

Each of these Repositories are accompanied by a README.md which instructs the viewer on what this repository is show-casing
in terms of the concept it is describing along with a snippet of code. The python file also contains rather in-depth 
comments throughout as well.

There was also the case of the exercises that were set over the weekend which are a little different to the OOP repositories
that have been made in today business day, instead they use examples that we have come up with to best explain the concept
to ourselves, in case we need a refresher in the future. The homework's repositories can be found below.
