I enjoyed yesterday and really was excited to get into JSON and XML type data formats as it is quite a popular way
of communicating data over the internet, particularly the API aspects as they return large amount of data. The last hour that we
got free was really good as it allowed us more time to talk after the lesson and personally more time to work on revision.
